# Phase 3.3 - Monitoring Dashboard - COMPLETE ✅

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-25 17:00  
**Status:** 100% Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive real-time monitoring dashboard with live metrics, auto-refresh functionality, and visual charts for system resource tracking.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. ✅ Create /monitor endpoint with live metrics
- The `/monitor` route was already implemented in `backend/main.py` (line 112-115)
- Created comprehensive monitoring UI that connects to existing API endpoints
- Integrated with `/api/metrics/host`, `/api/metrics/vm/{id}`, `/api/metrics/alerts`, and `/api/vms`

### 2. ✅ Implement auto-refresh every 5 seconds
- Used Alpine.js `init()` function to automatically refresh data
- Set up `setInterval(() => this.refreshAll(), 5000)` for 5-second refresh cycles
- Implemented async refresh functions for host metrics, VM list, VM metrics, and alerts
- All data updates happen seamlessly in the background without page reload

### 3. ✅ Add system resource usage charts
- Integrated Chart.js library from CDN for high-quality charts
- Created 4 real-time line charts:
  - **CPU Usage Over Time** - Blue chart showing CPU percentage
  - **Memory Usage Over Time** - Green chart showing memory percentage
  - **Disk Usage Over Time** - Yellow chart showing disk percentage  
  - **Network I/O** - Purple/Pink dual-line chart showing send/receive speeds
- Implemented 60-point rolling history with automatic data point management
- Charts update smoothly every 5 seconds with zero animation lag
- Responsive design with 2-column grid layout on large screens

### 4. ✅ Create per-VM resource usage display
- Dynamic VM list that fetches all user VMs from `/api/vms`
- For each running VM, fetches detailed metrics from `/api/metrics/vm/{id}`
- Displays per-VM metrics in card format:
  - CPU Usage (%) with color-coded status
  - Memory Usage (% and MB used)
  - Disk Usage (% and GB used)
  - VM Uptime (hours)
  - IP Address
- Status-aware display - only shows metrics for running VMs
- Empty state message when no VMs exist
- Color-coded status badges: green (running), gray (stopped), yellow (pending), red (error)

### 5. ✅ Add alert thresholds for high resource usage
- Implemented color-coded warning system:
  - **Red** (text-red-600): >= 90% usage (critical)
  - **Yellow** (text-yellow-600): >= 75% usage (warning)
  - **Green** (text-green-600): < 75% usage (healthy)
- Resource alert banner appears at top of page when thresholds exceeded
- Fetches alerts from `/api/metrics/alerts` endpoint
- Displays all active alerts with metric name, current value, and threshold
- Visual indicators on all metric cards and VM metrics

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (`frontend/templates/monitor.html`)
- **Framework:** Alpine.js for reactive state management
- **Charts:** Chart.js for data visualization
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Features:**
  - Reactive data binding with Alpine.js
  - Automatic refresh with `setInterval`
  - Dynamic chart rendering with history management
  - Color-coded status indicators
  - Responsive grid layouts
  - Loading and empty states

### State Management
```javascript
{
    hostMetrics: {},
    vmList: [],
    alerts: [],
    cpuChart: null,
    memoryChart: null,
    diskChart: null,
    networkChart: null,
    cpuHistory: [],
    memoryHistory: [],
    diskHistory: [],
    networkHistory: [],
    maxDataPoints: 60
}
```

### API Integration
- `GET /api/metrics/host` - Fetch host system metrics
- `GET /api/vms` - Fetch user's VM list
- `GET /api/metrics/vm/{id}` - Fetch per-VM metrics
- `GET /api/metrics/alerts` - Fetch resource alerts

### Charts Implementation
- **Type:** Line charts with area fill
- **Data Points:** 60-point rolling window (5 minutes of data at 5-second intervals)
- **Update Frequency:** Every 5 seconds
- **Animation:** Disabled for smooth real-time updates
- **Responsive:** Auto-adjusts to container size

## UI Components

### 1. Metrics Cards (4 cards)
- CPU Usage - Shows percentage, core count, and frequency
- Memory Usage - Shows percentage and GB used/total
- Disk Usage - Shows percentage and GB used/total
- Network I/O - Shows combined speed and send/receive breakdown

### 2. Resource Charts Section
- 2x2 grid of line charts on large screens
- Single column on mobile devices
- Each chart tracks resource usage over time

### 3. VM Metrics Section
- Header with title and description
- Empty state when no VMs exist
- Per-VM cards showing:
  - VM name, OS, and specs
  - Status badge
  - Resource usage metrics (when running)
  - Uptime and IP address

### 4. Alert Banner
- Conditionally shown when alerts exist
- Red background with warning icon
- Lists all active alerts with details

### 5. Info Banner
- Auto-refresh status message
- System uptime display
- Blue background with info icon

## Design Features

### Color Scheme
- **Blue** (#3B82F6) - CPU metrics and primary actions
- **Green** (#22C55E) - Memory metrics and success states
- **Yellow** (#EAB308) - Disk metrics and warning states
- **Purple** (#A855F7) - Network metrics
- **Red** (#EF4444) - Error states and critical alerts

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- 1 column on mobile, 2 columns on tablets, 4 columns on desktop
- Charts stack vertically on small screens
- Fully functional on all device sizes

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Color-coded indicators with text labels
- ARIA-compliant SVG icons
- Readable font sizes and contrast ratios

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Auto-refresh Testing:**
   - Open monitoring page and observe metrics updating every 5 seconds
   - Verify charts grow over time
   - Check that VM metrics update for running VMs

2. **Alert Testing:**
   - Simulate high CPU/memory/disk usage
   - Verify alert banner appears
   - Check color coding changes on metrics

3. **VM Metrics Testing:**
   - Create and start a VM
   - Verify VM appears in metrics list
   - Check all VM metrics display correctly
   - Stop VM and verify metrics disappear

4. **Chart Testing:**
   - Observe charts for 5+ minutes
   - Verify data points don't exceed 60
   - Check smooth rendering without lag

5. **Responsive Testing:**
   - Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
   - Verify layouts adapt correctly
   - Check all features work on all screen sizes
