- Real-time text search functionality
- "Apply Filters" and "Clear Filters" buttons

### 4. Live Event Feed
- Scrollable event feed with color-coded severity
- Blue for Info, Yellow for Warning, Red for Critical
- Displays timestamp, event type, severity, and message
- Shows VM ID and User ID badges when applicable
- Clickable event cards for detailed view

### 5. Event Detail Modal
- Shows complete event information
- Displays: ID, Type, Severity, Message, Timestamp, VM/User IDs
- Shows additional details in formatted JSON
- Smooth transitions with Alpine.js

### 6. Event Export Functionality
- Downloads filtered events as JSON file
- Filename includes timestamp
- Uses Blob API for client-side download

### 7. User Experience Features
- Loading states with spinner
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Auto-refresh notification banner
- "Last update" timestamp display

## Technical Details

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Alpine.js for state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Auto-refresh**: JavaScript setInterval (3 seconds)
- **API**: Fetch API with JWT authentication

### Backend Integration
- Integrated with existing SOC API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/soc/events` - Event retrieval
  - `GET /api/soc/statistics` - Statistics
- All backend functionality already implemented in Phase 4.1

### Code Quality
- Clean, maintainable Alpine.js component
- Follows existing code patterns
- Consistent with monitor.html and dashboard.html implementations
- No HTMX used - pure Alpine.js for better state management

## Files Modified
- `frontend/templates/soc.html` - Complete rewrite (509 lines)
- `progress.md` - Updated task checkboxes and progress summary

## Files Created
- `PHASE_4.2_4.3_COMPLETE.md` - Detailed completion documentation

## Progress Update

### Before
- Phase 4 (SOC Dashboard): 56% (5/9 tasks)
- Overall Progress: 54% (56/103 tasks)

### After
- Phase 4 (SOC Dashboard): 100% (15/15 tasks) ✅
- Overall Progress: 64% (66/103 tasks)

### Phases Complete
- ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (100%)
- ✅ Phase 2: VM Lifecycle (100%)
- ✅ Phase 3: Monitoring (100%)
- ✅ Phase 4: SOC Dashboard (100%)
- ⏳ Phase 5: Admin Dashboard (Next)

## Next Steps
According to progress.md, the next task is:

**Phase 5.1 - Admin Panel Backend**
- Create admin-specific API endpoints
- Implement user management functionality
- Add credit adjustment system
- Create VM overview for all users
- Add admin authentication middleware

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Access SOC Dashboard**: Navigate to `/soc` after login
2. **View Events**: Should see live event feed with auto-refresh
3. **Test Filters**: Try different event types, severities, and time ranges
4. **Test Search**: Type keywords to filter events
5. **View Details**: Click any event to see detail modal
6. **Export Events**: Click "Export Events" button to download JSON

## Notes
- Backend SOC functionality was already complete from Phase 4.1
- This task focused on the frontend implementation
- Used Alpine.js instead of HTMX for better state management
- Follows the same patterns as monitor.html and dashboard.html
- All event correlation and alert rules are already implemented in backend

✅ All 5 tasks in Phase 4.3 marked complete
✅ Progress summary updated (64% complete)
✅ Current focus updated to Phase 5.1
✅ Recent changes section updated with detailed notes
