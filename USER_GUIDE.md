## Tips and Tricks

### Efficient VM Management

1. **Use templates**: Create a base VM and clone it (future feature)
2. **Tag your VMs**: Use naming conventions like `project-env-purpose`
3. **Schedule start/stop**: Note down when you actually need VMs
4. **Monitor costs**: Check credit consumption weekly

### Terminal Productivity

1. **Use screen/tmux**: Keep sessions alive across disconnects
2. **Save scripts**: Store common commands in files
3. **Use aliases**: Create shortcuts for frequent commands
4. **Keep logs**: Redirect output to files for later review

### Monitoring Insights

1. **Baseline metrics**: Note normal resource usage levels
2. **Set reminders**: Check monitoring daily
3. **Watch trends**: Look for gradual increases in resource use
4. **Compare VMs**: Identify which VMs use most resources
