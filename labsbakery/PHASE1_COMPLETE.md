## üìù Notes & Observations

### What Went Well:
- Clean separation of concerns (models, routes, services)
- Comprehensive schema validation
- Export/import system works as designed
- UI is intuitive and responsive
- Good foundation for future phases

### Challenges Overcome:
- None significant - Phase 1 went smoothly

### Technical Debt:
- TODO comments in code for Phase 2+ integration
- Need to add comprehensive unit tests
- Need to add integration tests
- Documentation could be expanded

### Recommendations:
1. Add unit tests before Phase 2
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Consider Docker containerization
4. Add logging throughout codebase
5. Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
